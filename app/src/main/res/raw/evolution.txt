Evolution

Evolution is the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations and natural selection.

Key Principles:
- Natural Selection: Organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce.
- Adaptation: Traits that improve survival in a given environment.
- Speciation: Formation of new species due to reproductive isolation.
- Common Descent: All organisms share a common ancestor.
- Fossil Record: Preserved remains of ancient life forms.
- Evolutionary Trees: Show relationships among species.

Mechanisms of Evolution:
- Mutation: Random changes in DNA.
- Genetic Drift: Random changes in allele frequencies.
- Gene Flow: Transfer of genes between populations.
- Sexual Selection: Traits selected based on mating advantages.

Evidence for Evolution:
- Fossils, comparative anatomy, embryology, molecular biology.
