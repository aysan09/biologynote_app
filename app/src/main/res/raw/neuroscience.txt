Neuroscience

Neuroscience studies the structure and function of the nervous system.

Key Areas:
1. Neurons and Neuroglia:
   - Structure and types of neurons.
   - Synapses, neurotransmitters, and signal transmission.

2. Brain Structure and Function:
   - Cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem.
   - Memory, emotions, movement control.

3. Neural Communication:
   - Action potentials and synaptic transmission.
   - Excitatory and inhibitory signaling.

4. Sensory Systems:
   - Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.
   - Processing of sensory information.

5. Motor Systems:
   - Reflex arcs and voluntary movement.
   - Role of the spinal cord and motor cortex.

6. Neurological Disorders:
   - Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy.
   - Mental health and neural dysfunction.

Applications:
- Brain imaging, neuroprosthetics, neural engineering.
