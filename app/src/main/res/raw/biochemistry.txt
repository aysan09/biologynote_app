Biochemistry

Biochemistry focuses on the chemical processes and molecules essential for life.

Key Areas:
1. Biomolecules:
   - Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids.
   - Roles and structures of major biological molecules.

2. Enzymes:
   - Catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions.
   - Factors affecting enzyme activity like pH and temperature.

3. Metabolism:
   - Catabolism and anabolism.
   - ATP production and energy flow in cells.

4. Cellular Respiration:
   - Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain.
   - Aerobic and anaerobic pathways.

5. Photosynthesis:
   - Light reactions and the Calvin cycle.
   - Production of glucose and oxygen.

6. Genetic Information Flow:
   - DNA replication, transcription, translation.
   - Central dogma of molecular biology.

Applications:
- Medicine, drug design, nutrition, biotechnology.
