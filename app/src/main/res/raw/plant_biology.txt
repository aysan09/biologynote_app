Plant Biology

Plant Biology is the study of plant structure, function, growth, reproduction, and adaptation.

Key Areas:
1. Plant Cells and Tissues:
   - Cell walls, chloroplasts, vacuoles.
   - Meristematic and permanent tissues.
   - Transport systems (xylem and phloem).

2. Photosynthesis:
   - Light-dependent and light-independent reactions.
   - Role of chlorophyll in energy capture.
   - Factors affecting photosynthesis.

3. Plant Physiology:
   - Transpiration, respiration, nutrient absorption.
   - Plant hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins.
   - Tropisms and responses to environmental stimuli.

4. Reproduction in Plants:
   - Sexual and asexual reproduction.
   - Pollination, fertilization, seed formation, germination.

5. Plant Diversity and Evolution:
   - Non-vascular and vascular plants.
   - Gymnosperms and angiosperms.
   - Adaptations for survival in different environments.

Applications:
- Agriculture, plant breeding, forestry, medicinal plants.
