Key Areas:
1. Ecosystems and Biomes:
   - Forests, deserts, grasslands, oceans.
   - Energy flow and nutrient cycles.

2. Biodiversity:
   - Species diversity and genetic variation.
   - Importance of conservation.

3. Environmental Challenges:
   - Pollution, climate change, habitat destruction.
   - Invasive species.

4. Population Ecology:
   - Population growth, carrying capacity.
   - Competition and predation.

5. Natural Resources:
   - Renewable and nonrenewable resources.
   - Sustainable resource use.

6. Conservation Biology:
   - Protection of ecosystems and species.
   - Restoration of damaged environments.

Applications:
- Environmental science, policy, and sustainability.
