Cell Biology

The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. All life forms are made up of cells. Cells can be classified into two main types:

1. Prokaryotic Cells:
   - Lack a defined nucleus.
   - Example: Bacteria and Archaea.
   - Contain ribosomes, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, but no membrane-bound organelles.

2. Eukaryotic Cells:
   - Contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
   - Examples: Plant cells, animal cells, fungi, protists.

Key Cell Structures:
- Nucleus: Stores genetic material (DNA) and coordinates activities like growth and reproduction.
- Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance containing organelles.
- Mitochondria: Produces energy via cellular respiration.
- Ribosomes: Synthesizes proteins.
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Rough ER synthesizes proteins; Smooth ER synthesizes lipids.
- Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins.
- Lysosomes: Digestive enzymes to break down waste.

Functions of Cells:
- Metabolism: Chemical reactions that sustain life.
- Growth: Increase in size and number of cells.
- Reproduction: Division to produce new cells.
- Response: React to environmental stimuli.
