Biotechnology

Biotechnology is the use of living organisms or their systems to develop products or processes for human benefit.

Key Areas:
1. Genetic Engineering:
   - Modification of an organism's DNA.
   - Techniques: Recombinant DNA, CRISPR, gene cloning.
   - Applications: GMOs, disease-resistant crops, insulin production.

2. Medical Biotechnology:
   - Vaccine development, gene therapy, personalized medicine.
   - Use of stem cells for regenerative therapies.

3. Agricultural Biotechnology:
   - Development of high-yield crops, pest-resistant plants, drought-tolerant varieties.

4. Industrial Biotechnology:
   - Production of enzymes, biofuels, bioplastics, and chemicals.

5. Environmental Biotechnology:
   - Waste management, pollution control, bioremediation.

6. Microbial Biotechnology:
   - Use of bacteria and fungi for fermentation (cheese, antibiotics, alcohol).

Ethical Considerations:
- Safety of GMOs for humans and environment.
- Genetic privacy and gene editing ethics.
- Regulation and monitoring of biotechnological products.

Future Prospects:
- Synthetic biology, artificial organs, bio-computing.
- Advancing healthcare, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
