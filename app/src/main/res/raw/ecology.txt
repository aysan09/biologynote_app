Ecology

Ecology is the scientific study of interactions between organisms and their environment.

Key Concepts:
- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms and their physical environment.
- Biotic Factors: Living components like plants and animals.
- Abiotic Factors: Non-living components like water, soil, and climate.
- Food Chain: Linear sequence of energy transfer.
- Food Web: Complex network of feeding relationships.
- Producers (Autotrophs): Make their own food via photosynthesis.
- Consumers (Heterotrophs): Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores.
- Decomposers: Break down organic matter and recycle nutrients.
- Biodiversity: Variety and variability of life forms.
- Ecological Succession: Gradual replacement of one community by another.
