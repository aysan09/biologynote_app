Microbiology

Microbiology is the study of microorganisms, which are organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye.

Types of Microorganisms:
1. Bacteria:
   - Single-celled prokaryotes.
   - Shapes: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod), spirilla (spiral).
   - Can be beneficial (gut microbiota) or pathogenic (cause disease).

2. Viruses:
   - Non-living infectious agents.
   - Require a host cell to reproduce.
   - Examples: Influenza virus, HIV, Coronavirus.

3. Fungi:
   - Eukaryotic organisms (yeasts, molds, mushrooms).
   - Decomposers in ecosystems; some cause disease.

4. Protozoa:
   - Single-celled eukaryotes.
   - Often found in water; some cause malaria or amoebiasis.

5. Algae:
   - Photosynthetic eukaryotes.
   - Produce oxygen and form the base of aquatic food chains.

6. Archaea:
   - Prokaryotes living in extreme environments.
   - Not harmful to humans but important for research.

Applications of Microbiology:
- Medicine: Antibiotics, vaccines, disease diagnosis.
- Agriculture: Soil fertility, nitrogen fixation.
- Biotechnology: Fermentation, enzyme production.
- Environmental: Waste treatment, bioremediation.

Important Techniques:
- Microscopy: Light and electron microscopes.
- Culturing: Growing microbes in controlled conditions.
- Staining: Gram staining for bacterial classification.
- Molecular Methods: PCR, DNA sequencing for identification.
