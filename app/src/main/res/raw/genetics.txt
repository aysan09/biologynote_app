Genetics

Genetics is the branch of biology that studies heredity and variation in organisms. It explains how traits are passed from parents to offspring.

Key Concepts:
- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The molecule that carries genetic instructions.
- Genes: Segments of DNA responsible for specific traits.
- Chromosomes: Thread-like structures containing many genes.
- Alleles: Different versions of a gene (dominant or recessive).

Inheritance Patterns:
- Mendelian Inheritance: Dominant and recessive traits.
- Co-dominance: Both alleles are expressed.
- Sex-linked Inheritance: Traits linked to X or Y chromosomes.

Mutations:
- Changes in DNA sequence.
- Can be harmful, neutral, or beneficial.
- Source of genetic variation.

Applications:
- Genetic engineering: Modifying genes for agriculture or medicine.
- Disease prevention: Identifying hereditary disorders.
