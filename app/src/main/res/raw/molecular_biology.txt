Molecular Biology

Molecular Biology explores how genetic information is stored, expressed, and regulated within cells.

Key Areas:
1. DNA and RNA:
   - Structure of nucleic acids.
   - Roles of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

2. DNA Replication:
   - Enzymes such as helicase and DNA polymerase.
   - Semi-conservative replication mechanism.

3. Gene Expression:
   - Transcription, RNA processing, and translation.
   - Protein synthesis.

4. Gene Regulation:
   - Operons, transcription factors, epigenetics.
   - Control of gene activity.

5. Mutations:
   - Point mutations, insertions, deletions.
   - Effects on proteins and traits.

6. Molecular Techniques:
   - PCR, electrophoresis, sequencing.
   - CRISPR and genetic engineering.

Applications:
- Medicine, biotechnology, agriculture.
