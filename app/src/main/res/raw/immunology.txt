   - First line of defense including skin, mucus, and inflammation.
   - Rapid, non-specific immune response.

2. Adaptive Immunity:
   - B-cells, T-cells, and antibodies.
   - Memory formation and long-term protection.

3. Antigens and Antibodies:
   - Structure and function of antibodies.
   - Specific antigen recognition.

4. Immune System Organs:
   - Thymus, bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes.

5. Vaccines:
   - Live-attenuated, inactivated, and mRNA vaccines.
   - Concepts of immunity and disease prevention.

6. Immune Disorders:
   - Autoimmune diseases, allergies, hypersensitivity.
   - Immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV.

Applications:
- Vaccine development, immunotherapy, diagnostic testing.
